The roles CONNECT, RESOURCE and DBA are now deprecated (supported only for backwards compatibility) unless you are still running Oracle 6.0 use CREATE ROLE instead. Using deprecated roles is likely to result in a database installation that is not secure. Also beware of 3rd party packages that issue GRANT CONNECT instead of GRANT CREATE SESSION.
